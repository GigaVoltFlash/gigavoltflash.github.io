I'm Anshuk. I'm currently a Masters student in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at Stanford University. My specialization is in GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control), and Autonomy. I especially tend to emjoy applying these concepts to things that fly (hence the aerospace). Right now, I'm taking all the cool classes I can at Stanford to build my technical base in GNC and such, while also working on research in robot navigation through radiance field represenations of environments. 

I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I spent many late nights working on high-powered rocketry avionics systems with the [Illinois Space Society](https://www.illinoisspacesociety.org/), or doing my own little fun projects like taking a naive stab at a [flying inverted pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N7ZdDmsYzY).

I've been lucky enough to do some really cool work at some awesome internships over the past few years. I've spent Summer 2023 and 2022 between Starbase and LA interning at SpaceX on the Starship GNC and Flight Software teams (I worked on stuff for [Starship Flight 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_krgcofiM6M) and [Starship Flight 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3iHAgwIYtI)), mainly working on Superheavy Booster landing. In 2021, I interned at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa as a System/Software Integration Intern. In 2020, I was at Skyroot Aerospace as a GNC intern.

One of my big reasons for picking aerospace as a major back in 2018 was the iconic [Falcon Heavy test flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0FZIwabctw).

In 2020 (at age 19) I decided that a long-term life goal of mine is to play a significant role in landing humans on Mars. 

Other non-aerospace fun (maybe stereotypical) things about me:
* I grew up in Hyderabad, India and only moved to the US in 2019. Hyderabad is my home.
* I love Interstellar (watching the movie and listening to the music).
* I follow Formula 1 closely.
* I used to play Tabla in high school.
* My music taste includes Arijit Singh, Taylor Swift, Green Day, AJR, Kishore Kumar, Blackpink... (it's varied).
* I like bouldering but am only at a V3 level.
