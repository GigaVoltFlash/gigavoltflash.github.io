I'm Anshuk. I'm currently a Masters student in Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering at Stanford University. My specialization is in GNC (Guidance, Navigation, Control), and Autonomy. I especially tend to enjoy applying these concepts to things that fly (hence the aerospace). I'm taking all the cool classes I can at Stanford to build my technical base in GNC and autonomy, while also working on research in robot navigation through radiance field represenations of environments. 

I received my B.S. in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I spent many awesome nights working on high-powered rocketry avionics with the [Illinois Space Society](https://www.illinoisspacesociety.org/), or doing my own little projects (like a naive attempt at a [flying inverted pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7N7ZdDmsYzY)).

I spent Summer 2023 and 2022 between Starbase and LA interning at SpaceX on the Starship GNC and Flight Software teams ([Starship Flight 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_krgcofiM6M) and [Starship Flight 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3iHAgwIYtI)), mainly working on Superheavy Booster landing. In 2021, I interned at Collins Aerospace in Cedar Rapids, Iowa as a System/Software Integration Intern. In 2020, I was at Skyroot Aerospace as a GNC intern.

One of my big reasons for picking aerospace as a major back in 2018 was the iconic [Falcon Heavy test flight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0FZIwabctw).

In 2020 I decided that a long-term life goal of mine is to play a significant role in landing humans on Mars. 

<!-- Other non-aerospace fun (maybe stereotypical) things about me:
* I grew up in Hyderabad, India and only moved to the US in 2019. Hyderabad is my home.
* I love Interstellar (watching the movie and listening to the music).
* I follow Formula 1 closely.
* I used to play Tabla in high school.
* My music taste includes Arijit Singh, Taylor Swift, Green Day, AJR, Kishore Kumar, Blackpink... (it's varied).
* I like bouldering but am only at a V3 level. -->
